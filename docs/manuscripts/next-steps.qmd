-   Controlling manuscript settings in `_quarto.yml`

-   Adding notebooks to a manuscript:

    -   Adding notebooks that aren't used in article content
    -   Adding reproducible notebooks: adding other files (e.g. data), capturing the evaluation environment
    -   Controlling the execution of code in notebooks by Quarto

-   Converting an existing notebook, or project, to a manuscript. E.g. add `_quarto.yml`

-   Starting from scratch, e.g. `quarto create` -\> `project` -\> `manuscript`. Connect to GitHub

-   Adding other journal templates to a project
