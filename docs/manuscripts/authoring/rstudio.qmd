## Overview

On this page, we'll show you how to author an academic manuscript with Quarto in {{< meta tool.name >}}. You'll learn how to:

-   Preview your manuscript using the Quarto command line tool.

-   Add scholarly front matter to describe your article.

-   Add things like figures, tables, cross references and citations with Quarto specific markdown.

-   Include output from computations using inline code, or embedded from external notebooks.

### Is this tutorial for me?

We will assume you:

-   are comfortable using {{< meta tool.name >}} to open and edit files,
-   have a GitHub account, and are comfortable cloning a repo to your computer,
-   are comfortable navigating your file system, and executing commands in a Terminal.

## Setup

To follow along, you'll need to clone the template repository.

## Install Quarto First

If you haven't already, make sure you've installed the pre-release version of Quarto, as described in the [Manuscript Overview](../index.qmd#install).

### Clone the Template Repository {#clone-repo}

To follow this tutorial you'll need your own copy of the [template repository]({{< meta template-repo >}}).

1.  Head to [GitHub to create a new repository from the template]({{< meta template-repo >}}/generate).

    Provide a "Repository Name" and make sure you check the box "Include all branches". Then "Create repository from template". ![](images/github-create-from-template.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of GitHub's create a new repo from a template page. Repository name has been filled with manuscript-template, and the box labelled Include all branches is checked."}

2.  Once your repository is created, clone it to your local computer. You can do this any way you are comfortable, but one approach is to use File -> New Project

## Notebook Structure

The file `index.qmd` is a Quarto markdown file. It contains three types of content:

-   It starts with a YAML header that is used to set document metadata, including scholarly front matter. The YAML header starts and ends with a line of three dashes (`---`), and within these lines, content is parsed as YAML. 

-   It may include executable code chunks which start with three backticks followed by the code language in curly braces (e.g. ` ```{r} `). These code chunks may include Quarto comments at the top which start with `#|`. These comments set Quarto options that control how the code and its output appear in the article.

-   The rest of the document is interpreted as Quarto specific markdown, which allows you to include things like figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

The rest of this page walks you through this article from top to bottom, introducing you to the Quarto features you'll most likely need to write a scholarly article.

## Front Matter

{{< include _front-matter.qmd >}}

## Markdown

Markdown cells in the document will be processed by Quarto's specific markdown syntax. Quarto's markdown syntax is based on [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), which in turn is based on John Gruber's [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Some examples of basic syntax are shown below:
